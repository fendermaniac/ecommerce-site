- Basic Routing
- TODO: Param based routing for items sending user to product specific page.
- TODO: Protected routes.
- TODO: Social Login.
- Pull data from JSON source (Right now I have mock data, but I plan on building the API where I can create, read, update and delete data)
- Add items to cart. You should be able to see the quantity in your cart increase with the widget on the top right-hand side.
- View items in cart. TODO: Refactor application to show specific item along with quantity.
